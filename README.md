## Project Overview
This project implements a **real-time ray tracer** using **OpenGL 3.3**. The main highlights of the project include:
- **Ray marching volumetric clouds**
- **Triangular mesh rendering**
- **Dynamic ocean surface simulation**

---

## Features
- **Ray Marching Volumetric Clouds**:  
  Generates realistic clouds using ray marching and noise functions.  
- **Triangular Mesh Rendering**:  
  Supports dynamic rendering of triangular meshes with vertex and fragment shaders.  
- **Dynamic Ocean Surface Simulation**:  
  Real-time wave simulation for ocean surfaces using sinusoidal functions or FFT.  

---

## Setup Instructions
Follow the steps below to set up and run the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/XenonJ/Ray_Tracer_OpenGL.git
   cd Ray_Tracer_OpenGL
   ```

2. **Setup on MacOS**
    ``` bash
    brew install fltk glm glew
    ```

3. **Build**
    ``` bash
    make
    ```

4. **Run the Program**
    ``` bash
    ./demo
    ```

## Implementation Details
1. Ray Marching Volumetric Clouds
> + Generate 3D noise from the 2D-tiled map
> + Use adaptive stepsize for implementing the LOD
> + Add margin detect to naturalize the clouds near the edge of cloud box
> + Customize your own cloud with the interactive panel!!!

2. Triangular Mesh Rendering
> + calculating triangular mesh with xml scene graph, or read form ply file
> + convert triangular data into array and build KD Tree as a array
> + pass in the data as texture buffer and calculate intersection in shader

3. Dynamic Ocean Surface Simulation

4. Shaders and Render Pipeline

## Usage

1. Shader Management
+ Reload: Reloads the shader files for real-time updates.
2. Scene Files
+ Load File: Load a custom scene file.
+ Load PLY File: Import a triangular mesh in PLY format.
+ Load Plane: Loads a default plane mesh.
+ Load Noise File: Loads noise textures or data for volumetric clouds.
3. Cloud Panel

Adjust the cloud rendering properties:
+ Cloud Width: Adjusts the horizontal spread of the clouds.
+ Cloud Speed: Controls the speed of cloud movement.
+ Cloud Density: Controls how thick or sparse the clouds appear.
+ Cloud Bottom: Sets the lower altitude (height) of the clouds.
+ Cloud Top: Sets the upper altitude (height) of the clouds.
+ Sample Range: Controls the number of samples used for ray marching.

4. Camera Translate

Use these buttons to move the camera position:
+ UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT: Moves the camera along the X and Y axes.
+ FORWARD/BACK: Moves the camera along the Z-axis.

5. Mesh Translate

Move the loaded mesh or plane along different axes:
+ UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT: Moves the mesh horizontally or vertically.
+ FORWARD/BACK: Moves the mesh depth-wise.

6. Camera Rotate

Rotate the camera view using these sliders:
+ RotateU: Adjust rotation around the U-axis.
+ RotateV: Adjust rotation around the V-axis.
+ RotateW: Adjust rotation around the W-axis.

7. Shape Segments

Modify the mesh grid segmentation:
+ SegmentsX: Controls the number of horizontal segments.
+ SegmentsY: Controls the number of vertical segments.
